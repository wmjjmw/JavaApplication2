This project contains two parts:
1. Create an authoring tool used to assemble media, setup interactivity and "publish" content.
In particular, it provides functions for:
a) Importing a video, audio clip and one or more images onto an "authoring area".
b) Positioning video and images at some position in your scene.
c) Scaling the visual media types so that frame size or image size can be adjusted.
d) Display an object (such an image) for a set frame range (time range).
e) Go to a specific website with a mouse click when over a specific media object

2. Create an interactive player which will play the published content allowing users to interact with it.
